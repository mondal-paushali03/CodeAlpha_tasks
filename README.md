TASK 1: TITANIC CLASSIFICATION

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize parameters like n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples_split for the Random Forest classifier.

Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust predictions.

TASK 2: DATA CLEANING AND PROCESSING

This notebook involves cleaning and preparing a movie dataset with details like rating, name, and length. It includes data loading, cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions), and feature engineering. The dataset is then prepared for building predictive models. Follow the steps sequentially for reproducible results.

TASK 3: A/B TESTING

Objective: Compare open rates of Email A and Email B.

Data: 1,000 users, 30% open rate for A, 40% for B.

Tools: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.

Method: Bar chart and Chi-Square test.

Result: If p-value < 0.05, Email B is better.
